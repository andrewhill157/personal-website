        <p>(first author) On the design of CRISPR-based single-cell molecular screens<br/>
          <small>Several groups recently coupled CRISPR perturbations and single-cell rna-seq for pooled genetic screens. We demonstrate that vector designs of these studies are susceptible to ~50% swapping of guide RNAâ€“barcode associations because of lentiviral template switching. We optimized a published alternative, CROP-seq, in which the guide rna also serves as the barcode,
and here confirm that this strategy performs robustly and doubled the rate at which guides are assigned to cells to 94%.</small></p>
