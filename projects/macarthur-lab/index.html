    <h1>MacArthur Lab of MGH and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT</h1>  

    <p class="leadText">The <a href="http://www.macarthurlab.org/home/">MacArthur Lab</a> focuses on extracting useful information from human genome sequences. Some of the main focuses of the lab are accurate identification of sequence variants from massive data-sets, identifying LoF variants, using transcriptome sequencing approches to characterize the impact of DNA sequence variants on human gene function, and using genomic approaches to discover disease-causing mutations in severe disease patients.</p>

        <div class="projectBody">
            <p>I have created a Python script and OpenRefine recipe to automate data extraction and cleanup from the Leiden muscular dystrophy gene variant databases. I have also converted variants given in HGVS notation (relative to cDNA transcripts) to genomic coordinates and validated the results via annotation in order to facilitate use in large-scale data analytics efforts.</p>
