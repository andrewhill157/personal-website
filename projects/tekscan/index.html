        <p>I helped to co-develop a software development kit (SDK) that enables users to write custom applications using our hardware and data files. This SDK is based on the .NET framework, making it compatible with MATLAB, LabVIEW, C#, and other popular computing platforms. I have been primarily resonsible for enuring compatibility with each of our these supported platforms, writing sample code, documentation, and testing on a variety of platforms. I have also written two sample applications using this SDK for use by the sales team and written a program to check for product updates on our live updates server. This new product will provide additional power to customers and expedite internal custom software development.</p>

    <div class="projectBody">
        <p>As part of a larger custom software project for an outside comapny, I have led the investigation of the use of neural networks and other machine learning algorithms to estimate shoes size from pressure sensor data. We have collected sample data from many subjects with precisely measured shoe sizes. We hope to accurately estimate this shoe size within a half size by implementing appropriate machine learning algorithms. Using MATLAB, I have implemented a neural network fitting algorithm with a variable number of layers and hidden units that has improved upon the previous approach. As this project moves forward, we are hoping to further improve performance and investigate potential alternatives.</p>
