        <p>Tekscan's custom software development offerings to customers have previously been difficult to use and maintain. Along with several other engineers, I helped to co-develop a revamped software development kit (SDK) that enables users to write custom applications using our hardware and data files. This SDK is based on the .NET framework and written in C#, making it compatible with MATLAB, LabVIEW, C#, and other popular computing platforms.</p>
		<p>I have been primarily responsible for ensuring compatibility with each of our these supported platforms, writing demo applications and sample code, documentation, and testing on a variety of platforms. I have also developed an application to check for product updates on Tekscan's live updates server. I am very excited about this product because it promises to provide additional power to customers and expedite internal custom software development.</p>

    <div class="projectBody">
        <p>As part of a larger custom software project for a third-party company, I have led an initial investigation of the use of neural networks and other machine learning algorithms to estimate subject shoe size from pressure sensor data alone. This is a non-trivial problem because of inconsistencies in the sensor measurements and variations with user weight and sensor sensitivity.</p>
		<p>We have collected sample data from many subjects with precisely measured shoe sizes and hope to estimate this shoe size within a half size by implementing appropriate machine learning algorithms. Using MATLAB, I have implemented a neural network fitting algorithm with a variable number of layers and hidden units that has improved upon the previous approach. As this project moves forward, we hope to further improve performance and investigate potential enhancements.</p>
