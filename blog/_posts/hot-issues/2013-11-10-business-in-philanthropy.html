<p>National Instruments recently held their regional <a href="http://us.ni.com/nidays/boston">NI days conference</a> for New England customers here in Boston. While I gladly accepted the invitation in hopes of robotic awesomeness, an opportunity to try out their swanky new embedded controls products (<a href="http://www.ni.com/compactrio/">cRIO</a>), and of course free food, these were not the highlight of the event for me. Don't get me wrong; everything I went for was there in full-force, but the final speaker of the event, engineer and inventor Dean Kamen, made the event truly memorable.</p>

<p>For those of you who don't know, Dean Kamen is the inventor of the insulin pump, the portable dialysis machine, and the <a href="http://www.segway.com/">Segway</a> (yes, the Segway) amongst many other things. Engineers don't always make for the most dynamic presenters, so to be honest, I almost decided to leave before the presentation. I am incredibly glad that I stayed. It turns out that Dean Kamen is kind of a big deal. Like a really big deal.</p>

<p>Kamen currently owns <a href="http://www.dekaresearch.com/index.shtml">DEKA Research and Development</a>, an engineering research and development corporation of about 400 engineers. Recently, they have developed a portable water distillation system and accompanying generator that can purify any form of contaminated water (organics, inorganics, heavy metals, you name it) and power itself from virtually any combustible fuel source (methane from a pile of cow manure, for example). Kamen claims that a single unit can produce 1000 liters of clean water per day. Despite the technology behind this powerful device, Kamen posed a very interesting question. How do you get these things all over the world to the people who need them? Most companies, even massive companies like National Instruments, only operate in roughly 80 of the over 200 countries in the world, excluding many of the ones in the most dire need of resources. Kamen noted that there is one company in virtually every country in the world, Coca-Cola.</p>

<p>Traditionally, philanthropic organizations have been hesitant to partner with large corporations, especially mega-corporations like Coca-Cola. To put the sheer size of Coca-Cola in perspective, if <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/facts-about-coca-cola-2011-6?op=1">Coca-Cola (2011)</a> was a country, it would rank as the 84th largest economy of any country in the world, raking in over 35 billion in revenue and a net brand value estimated at 74 billion dollars. Coca-Cola is so ubiquitous that an estimated 94% of the world's population recognizes their logo. Coca-Cola sits firmly in the for-profit sector and is one of the largest companies in the world. Kamen, like many researchers and not-for-profit organizations, is not necessarily aligned with all the values of these mega corporations, but expressed a point that is very difficult to argue with. What if, in the interest of helping as many people as possible, DEKA could leverage Coca-Cola's phenomenal distribution capabilities to get their new machine all around the world.</p>

<p>At this point, you might be skeptical, and with good reason. Why would Coca-Cola ever agree to distribute Kamen's machines all over the world for little to no profit? Kamen, being a bit of a celebrity and having 400 engineers at his disposal, claims he agreed to help Coca-Cola develop a new line of soda-mixing dispensers in exchange for a distribution deal. After he inevitably succeeded in developing their fancy new mixer, they agreed to begin distribution on one condition: the machine had to be Coca-Cola branded. The company has already begun distribution of these new machines in several countries throughout Africa and South America. In addition to supplying a huge amount of fresh water, their plans extend to providing Internet and electricity, all in the same simple, zero-maintenance (for 3-5 years at a time) package. The project, termed <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/25/dean-kamen-slingshot-inventor_n_2951354.html">Slingshot</a>, is an effort to increase overall quality of life in the world by providing the most basic components of any functioning country and economy.</p>

<p>Certainly, this is to be taken with a grain of salt; there are much more complex issues at work in many of these countries that are deeply rooted in economic and political factors. However, it is also easy to argue that these seemingly crippling social and political issues likely stem from a lack of basic resources. As this effort continues to expand, it will be interesting to see what impact these efforts actually have.</p>

<p>After discussing some other impressive projects, Kamen moved on to speaking about <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">FIRST</a>. Kamen's organization FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is responsible for the now hugely successful FIRST Robotics competition. FIRST is a major proponent of STEM careers and seeks to inspire and foster children's interests, particularly minorities and women, in science and technology. Kamen has grown this organization from a small room full of people, to a major event with almost 650 teams nationwide. Again, he expressed how he is continuing to leverage partnerships with large corporations for the common good. By fostering his relationship with National Instruments, whose LabVIEW software and cRIO hardware is now widely used in FIRST leagues, he has secured over 10 million dollars worth of free hardware and software for FIRST competitors and spurred development of simplified LabVIEW-like software for FIRST Lego League. As a celebrity of sorts, Kamen has even established relationships with stars like <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5831235/william-hosts-dean-kamens-robotics-championship">will.i.am</a>, <a href="http://floost.com/billgates-post-a-day-at-deka-research-with-dean-kamen-2009862">Bill Gates</a>, <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/78037/november-09-2006/dean-kamen">Stephen Colbert (particularly entertaining)</a>, and <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/news/4337832">President Obama</a> who have each gone on to promote FIRST and Kamen's other efforts. Furthermore, the current CEOs of Coca-Cola and <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm</a> are on the FIRST board of directors, emphasizing the key role of corporations and celebrities in advancing Kamen's efforts.</p>

<p>The common thread in each project is leveraging the power of corporations to enhance philanthropic efforts. While not in line with traditional perceptions of philanthropy, global health, and research, the role of corporations such as Coca-Cola and National Instruments in Kamen's efforts has been integral to his widespread success. By leveraging the immense power of these businesses, Kamen has reached far more people and had a much greater impact than he could possibly have achieved alone. This is a philosophy that many could benefit from in the non-profit sector. Interest in this idea of stronger ties between corporations and philanthropic efforts has been recieving substantial attention (articles in the <a href="http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/collaborative_disruption_in_the_nonprofit_world">Stanford University Social Innovation Review</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/geristengel/2013/04/09/nonprofit-collaborations-why-teaming-up-can-make-sense/">Forbes</a>, for example), perhaps mirroring a shifting paradigm. Financial resources and power, like it or not, are major drivers of success. While it may seem counterintuitive, spending time and money on marketing, distribution, and relationships with industry has shown success in creating more effective philanthropic organizations. Many of Kamen's projects would have had negligible impact or never gotten off the ground without the help of big corporations. If the end goal is helping as many people as effectively as possible, shouldn't we be willing to put differences aside and work with big business?</p>
