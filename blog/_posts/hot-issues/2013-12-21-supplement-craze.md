Over the past week, dietary supplements have found their way back into national news after [studies published in the Annals of Internal Medicine](http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789253) showed that long term supplementation had little to no benefit in preventing several different chronic diseases. Media coverage of these findings has been rather prolific ([NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/12/17/251955878/the-case-against-multivitamins-grows-stronger), [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/16/health/multivitamins-studies/), [NYT](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/16/a-challenge-to-vitamins/?_r=0), the list goes on...) so rather than focus on these findings in particular, I instead want to draw attention to the lesser known history concerning the use of supplement regiments for treatment and/or prevention of chronic diseases. While these recent findings have received much public attention and been hyped by the media, scientists' battle against the public opinion that supplements are effective treatments for chronic disease has been ongoing for decades.

Perhaps the most seminal figure in this area is American chemist Linus Pauling, who is the only person in history to win two Nobel Prizes outright (one for peace and one for chemistry). Pauling was also the youngest ever member of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most prolific and impactful scientists in American history. Perhaps his lesser known contribution to the world of science and medicine is the spurring of the American dietary supplement craze.

After a speech in 1966, Pauling recalled, "I mentioned how much pleasure I took in reading about the discoveries made by scientists in their various investigations of 
the nature of the world, and stated that I hoped I could live another twenty-five years in order to continue to have this pleasure. On my return to California I received 
a letter from a biochemist, Irwin Stone, who had been at the talk. He wrote that if I followed his recommendation of taking 3,000 milligrams of vitamin C, I would live not 
only 25 years longer, but probably more." Pauling not only entertained such an unjustified claim, but began to add vitamin C into his diet, "I began to feel livelier and 
healthier. In particular, the severe colds I had suffered several times a year all my life no longer occurred. After a few years, I increased my intake of vitamin C to 
ten times, then twenty times, and then three hundred times the RDA: now 18,000 milligrams per day."

After perceiving a benefit in his own quality of life, Pauling went on to publish [Vitamin C and the Common Cold](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2807545-vitamin-c-the-common-cold-and-the-flu), which advised the general public to take 3000 mg of vitamin C per day. Pauling professed that such a recommendation would allow the common 
cold to be completely controlled within the United States within years. Pauling being a two time Nobel Laureate held a vast amount of influence over public opinion. In the early 1970's Pauling's book gained national popularity. "Sales of vitamin C doubled, tripled, and quadrupled. Drugstores couldn't keep up with demand. By the mid-1970s, 50 million Americans were following Pauling's advice. Vitamin manufacturers called it "the Linus Pauling effect." To put this in perspective, Americans today spend roughly $28 billion per year on supplements. An estimated 40% of Americans take multi-vitamins. ([NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/12/17/251955878/the-case-against-multivitamins-grows-stronger))

Scientists and physicians were quick to push back against these claims, but Pauling continued to publish in a variety of media. Pauling would later implicate vitamin
C in reducing risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and that various combinations of vitamin C and other supplements could treat/prevent a laundry list
of ailments ranging from heart disease to asthma and diabetes. A testament to his influence on public opinion, the cover of Time magazine in April 6, 1992 featured a 
cover article, _The Real Power of Vitamins: New research shows they may help fight cancer, heart disease, and the ravages of aging_, further promoting Pauling's 
claims in mainstream media. Meanwhile, studies carried out in the scientific community were far from conclusive.

While the studies showing no benefit from using supplement regimens to treat chronic disease vastly outweigh support for many of Pauling's claims, the public perception of supplements has continued to persist for decades. Here we are on the verge of 2014, almost 50 years after the start of Pauling's questionable promotion of supplements for the treatment/prevention of chronic diseases, still trying to undo the damage. Despite the fact that the recent studies in the Annals of Internal Medicine have received significant media attention, it remains to be seen if this will have any long-term impact on use of supplements for prevention of chronic disease.

More broadly, this is a testament to the negative impact that misinformation from the scientific community can have on public opinion. Scientists have the power to shape public opinion for better or worse. Propagation of scientific findings to the public occurs at an unprecedented pace and it may take years to correct public knowledge of inaccurate scientific findings; if this goal is ever achieved.

The quotes in this article and history of Linus Pauling are drawn from [The Vitamin Myth: Why We Think We Need Supplements](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/07/the-vitamin-myth-why-we-think-we-need-supplements/277947/), by Dr. Paul Offit of the University of Pennsylvania, which provides a detailed account of this aspect of Linus Pauling's history. I should also point out that the Linus Pauling Institute of Oregon State University wrote [this article expressing disagreement](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/news/offit-response.html) with portions of Dr. Offit's article. I highly recommend reading both the original article, the response, and information from other sources for a balanced perspective on the specific uses of supplements. I only seek to summarize the origins of the supplement craze, rather than comment on the legitimacy of any of Pauling's specific claims.
