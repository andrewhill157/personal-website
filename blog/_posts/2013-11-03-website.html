<p>After creating an initial version of this site over the last couple weeks, I decided to expand the site to include a blog and restructure the content. A static implementation for the site was appealing to me, but I found that managing the page content was quickly becoming a nightmare. By chance, I stumbled on a tool called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which its developers describe as a, "blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby."</p>

<p>While there is a small learning curve with Jekyll, it is actually very simple and has been extremely powerful in setting up this website. I came across a number of tutorials, of which, I found fellow Husky <a href="http://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example/">Andrew Munsell's</a> tutorial to be the most useful. As there is so much information available on the web elsewhere, I go into too much detail, but rather illustrate how Jekyll was useful for me.</p>

<p>Jekyll is a static HTML generator, which basically means that rather than spelling out every last line of code in your static HTML pages, that you can add tags <a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">(liquid tags)</a> into your HTML to include code from other sources. Once everything is ready to go and you run Jekyll on your website directory, it will actually replace all the tags with the HTML it produces, yielding fully functional HTML files. For example, if all your html pages have a common header and footer (like mine do), you can add tags to link to the header and footer HTML rather than copy them into every single file. This makes modifications a breeze and lets me focus on the unique content of each page.</p>

<p>As all of that is a bit abstract, I'll go though a simple example. Jekyll allows you to specify any number of layouts defining how content is displayed on a given page. Most of the pages on this website use a common layout, which is simply:</p>

<div class="codeblock"> <code> {% raw %}
{% include header.html %}
{{content}}
{% include footer.html %}
{% endraw %} </code> </div>

<p>The header and footer are simply HTML files are where I have placed all the code above and below the main page content (basically, everything outside the body). Pages using this layout can now be written as:</p>

<div class="codeblock"> <code> {% raw %}
---
title: mypage
layout: default
---
&lt;p&gt;My unique page content.&lt;p&gt;
{% endraw %} </code> </div>

<p>The lines of code between the ---'s (front-matter) basically tell Jekyll which layout to use on the given html file. When you run Jekyll on the website directory, everything below the second --- gets inserted in place of {% raw%}{{ contents }}{% endraw %} in the layout (along with the header and footer code, and end up in the final HTML file. On this blog page, where I also include a side-bar on the right, I specify a moderately more complex layout:</p>

<div class="codeblock"> <code> {% raw %}
&lt;div class=&quot;partition group&quot;&gt;	
  &lt;div class=&quot;col span_2_of_3&quot;&gt;	
    {{ content }}
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;col span_1_of_3&quot;&gt;
    {% include sidebar.html %}
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
{% endraw %} </code> </div>

<p>Here, I have included classes that (with the help of some CSS) break the page into a grid. The page content goes in the left two-thirds, and the side bar goes in the right third. Note that the html for the side bar is included from a seperate file. This allows it to be reused on other pages with a single liquid tag in the layout, a feature I find to be quite handy for including elements that appear unchanged on multiple pages. I have found this makes defining new pages and components very easy and eliminates a huge amount of redundancy.</p>


<p>Another powerful aspect of Jekyll is the fact that it can facilitate a blog (like this one) without any database or server-side code. Jekyll allows you to define markdown or HTML files containing your posts and any information about them such as a reference to a thumbnail photo and other custom variables. Jekyll can automatically generate permalinks for individual blog posts, break your blog page into multiple pages with a certain number of posts per page, and a number of other cool features. Jekyll also makes it easy to loop through any number of the most recent posts to display on a homepage along with excerpts, images, or whatever you would like.</p>

<p>Jekyll has been immensely useful for me and I hope you will check it out! The developers have extensive documentation on their <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">website</a> and <a href="http://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example/">Andrew Munsell's tutorial</a> was very helpful in getting started. Best of luck!</p>
