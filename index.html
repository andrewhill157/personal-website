<!-- My current research interests -->
<div class="section" id="interests">
  <h1>Interests</h1>
  <p class="leadText">Broadly, I am interested in the application of computation to biomedical research problems. I seek to advance our understanding of and ability to treat human disease. Additionally, I am interested in the well-planned application of technology to enhance the quality of healthcare.</p>

    <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/cloud-white.svg"></div>Big Data</h2>
    <p class="interestText">Scientific and clinical data are being collected in massive quantities. Effective data visualizations and analytics are helping to guide scientific research and inform clinicians. I am interested in researching new ways we can use this data.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col span_1_of_3">
   <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/regression-white.svg"></div>Machine Learning</h2>
   <p>Machine learning algorithms have proven to be very powerful tools in various fields of computational research. The amount of scientific data available is allowing these algorithms to be applied to complex problems in biomedical research.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="col span_1_of_3">
   <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/tool-white.svg"></div>Software Tools</h2>
   <p>Software tools are playing a critical role in making powerful and robust computational techniques accessible to the research community. I am interested in helping to develop better tools for computational biology and genomics.</p>

    <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/search-white.svg"></div>Genetic Variation</h2>
    <p>Variant calling tools still have trouble making accurate and comprehensive calls on mutations (particularly indels). I am interested in developing better tools and methods for more comprehensive and robust variant calling and classification.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col span_1_of_3">
   <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/network-white.svg"></div>Data Integration</h2>
   <p>I am excited about research that integrates genomic data, such as variants identified by GWAS, with other data sources, such as epigenetic data, tissue expression data, and protein interaction networks to elucidate genomic regulation.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="col span_1_of_3">
   <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/medicine-white.svg"></div>Personalized Medicine</h2>
   <p>The dropping price of DNA sequencing is enabling personalized testing through services offered by companies such as Counsyl, Ambry Genetics, and (pre-FDA issues) 23 and Me. I am excited about more widely applicable and robust clinical uses of DNA sequencing and analysis.</p>
