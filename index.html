  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <div id="headshot"><img src="/images/headshot.jpg"></div>
  <p class="leadText">My name is Andrew Hill and I am currently a graduate student in the <a href="http://www.gs.washington.edu/">UW Department of Genome Sciences</a> in Seattle, WA. I am rotating with <a href="http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/">Jay Shendure</a>, <a href="http://noble.gs.washington.edu/">Bill Noble</a>, and <a href="http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/">Cole Trapnell</a>.</p>

   <p class="leadText">Prior to coming to UW, I also worked as a research assistant and software developer in <a href="http://www.macarthurlab.org/">Daniel MacArthur's group </a> in the <a href="http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/">Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit</a> at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute in Boston, MA.</p>

<!-- My current research interests -->
<div class="section" id="interests">
  <h1>Interests</h1>
  <p class="leadText">Broadly, I am passionate about new technologies and methods in genomics. Specifically, I am currently very interested in novel applications of next generation sequencing technologies to examine problems in areas such as gene regulation, 3D genome architecture, cell fate decisions, clinical diagnostics, and functional interpretation of genetic variation. I also have an strong interest in Mendelian disease, population-scale genome sequencing datasets, and loss-of-function variation.</p>

<p class="leadText">While my current skill set is very much computational, I am beginning to expand towards adding experimental work to my own projects.</p>

    <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/search-white.svg"></div>Variant Annotation</h2>
    <p>I am interested in better tools and methods for more comprehensive and robust functional annotation of genetic variation. This spans computational methods like <a href="http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/">CADD</a> as well as functional assays like <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25141179">Saturation Mutagenesis</a>.</p>

   <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/network-white.svg"></div>Genome Architecture</h2>
   <p>Chromosome Conformation Capture techniques such as Hi-C are enabling more detailed querying of 3D genome architecture. I am interested in more advanced chromosome conformation capture technologies and uses of such data as it relates to gene regulation.</p>
