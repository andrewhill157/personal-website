        <h2><img class="smallIcon" src="images/search.svg">Genetic Variation</h2>
        <p>Variant calling tools still have trouble making accurate and comprehensive calls on mutations (particularly indels). I am interested in developing better tools and methods for more comprehensive and robust variant calling and classification.</p>

    <div class="col span_1_of_3">
       <h2><img class="smallIcon" src="images/network.svg">Data Integration</h2>
       <p>I am excited about research that integrates genomic data, such as variants identified by GWAS, with other data sources, such as epigenetic data, tissue expression data, and protein interaction networks to elucidate genomic regulation.</p>

   <div class="col span_1_of_3">
       <h2><img class="smallIcon" src="images/medicine.svg">Personalized Medicine</h2>
       <p>Companies like <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23 and Me</a> and traditional genetic counseling programs are providing people with information about their genome. I am interested in research that will allow more comprehensive interpretation of results and integration with other clinical metrics.</p>
