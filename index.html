    <div class="col span_1_of_3">
       <h2><img class="smallIcon" src="/images/regression.svg">Machine Learning</h2>
       <p>Machine learning algorithms have proven to be very powerful tools in various fields of computational research. The amount of scientific data available is allowing these algorithms to be applied to complex problems in biomedical research.</p>

        <h2><img class="smallIcon" src="/images/search.svg">Genetic Variation</h2>
        <p>Variant calling tools still have trouble making accurate and comprehensive calls on mutations (particularly indels). I am interested in developing better tools and methods for more comprehensive and robust variant calling and classification.</p>

    <div class="col span_1_of_3">
       <h2><img class="smallIcon" src="/images/network.svg">Data Integration</h2>
       <p>I am excited about research that integrates genomic data, such as variants identified by GWAS, with other data sources, such as epigenetic data, tissue expression data, and protein interaction networks to elucidate genomic regulation.</p>

   <div class="col span_1_of_3">
       <h2><img class="smallIcon" src="/images/medicine.svg">Personalized Medicine</h2>
       <p>Companies like <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23 and Me</a> and traditional genetic counselling programs are providing people with information about their genome. I am interested in research that will allow more comprehensive interpretation of results and integration with other clinical data.</p>
