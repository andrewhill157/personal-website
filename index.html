  <div id="headshot"><img src="/images/headshot.jpg"></div>
  <p class="leadText">My name is Andrew Hill and I currently work as a research assistant and software developer in <a href="http://www.macarthurlab.org/">Daniel MacArthur's group </a> in the <a href="http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/">Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit</a> at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute in Boston. In September 2014, I will be returning to Seattle as a graduate student in the <a href="http://www.gs.washington.edu/">University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences</a>.</p>

<!-- My current research interests -->
<div class="section" id="interests">
  <h1>Interests</h1>
  <p class="leadText">Broadly, I am interested in development of new technologies and computational approaches within genomics. Specifically, I am interested in novel applications of next generation sequencing technologies, particularly clinical applications of sequencing. I also have an interest in Mendelian disease research and loss-of-function variation.</p>

    <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/search-white.svg"></div>Variant Annotation</h2>
    <p>I am interested in developing better tools and methods for more comprehensive and robust functional annotation of variants, particularly loss-of-function variants.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col span_1_of_3">
   <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/network-white.svg"></div>Data Integration</h2>
   <p>The data generated by researchers and clinicians are highly heterogeneous, but are, in many cases, potentially powerful when used in combination. I am interested in research that seeks to leverage heterogenous data sources.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="col span_1_of_3">
   <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/medicine-white.svg"></div>Personalized Medicine</h2>
   <p>The dropping price of sequencing is moving to make clinical applications of exome and genome sequencing more widely viable. I am interested technologies and research that enables accurate and robust clinical interpretation of genetic variation.</p>
