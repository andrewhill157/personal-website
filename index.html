  <div id="headshot"><img src="/images/headshot.jpg"></div>
  <p class="leadText">My name is Andrew Hill and I am a graduate student and NSF graduate research fellow in the <a href="http://www.gs.washington.edu/">UW Department of Genome Sciences</a> in Seattle, WA. I work with <a href="http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/">Jay Shendure</a> and collaborate with <a href="http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/">Cole Trapnell</a> on new technologies and computational methods for genomics.</p>

   <p class="leadText">During my time at UW, I have also been a computational biology intern and consultant with <a href="http://www.10xgenomics.com/">10X Genomics</a>. Prior to coming to UW, I worked as a research assistant and software developer in <a href="http://www.macarthurlab.org/">Daniel MacArthur's group </a> in the <a href="http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/">Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit</a> at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute in Boston, MA.</p>
