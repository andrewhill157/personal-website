  <div id="headshot"><img src="/images/headshot.jpg"></div>
  <p class="leadText">My name is Andrew Hill and I am currently a graduate student and NSF graduate research fellow in the <a href="http://www.gs.washington.edu/">UW Department of Genome Sciences</a> in Seattle, WA. I work with <a href="http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/">Jay Shendure</a> and <a href="http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/">Cole Trapnell</a> on new technologies and computational methods for genomics.</p>

   <p class="leadText">Prior to coming to UW, I also worked as a research assistant and software developer in <a href="http://www.macarthurlab.org/">Daniel MacArthur's group </a> in the <a href="http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/">Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit</a> at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute in Boston, MA.</p>

  <h1>Interests</h1>
  <p class="leadText">Broadly, I am passionate about new technologies and methods in genomics. Specifically, I am currently very interested in problems in areas such as functional genomics, 3D genome architecture, cell fate decisions, and clinical applications of genomics.</p>

<p class="leadText">While my current skill set is very much computational, I am expanding into experimental work as part of my projects with Jay and Cole.</p>

    <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/search-white.svg"></div>Functional Genomics</h2>
    <p>I am interested in better tools and methods for more comprehensive and robust functional interpretation of genetic variation. This spans computational methods like <a href="http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/">CADD</a> as well as functional assays like <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25141179">Saturation Mutagenesis</a>.</p>

  <div class="col span_1_of_3">
   <h2><div class="smallIcon"><img src="/images/network-white.svg"></div>Cell Fate Decisions</h2>
   <p>Single-cell assays such as single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq are enabling dissection of complex dynamic processes like differentation. Currently, I am interested in both technological and computational advancements that exploit single-cell genomics assays to learn about cell fate decisions.</p>
